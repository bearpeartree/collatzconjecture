Trying to visualize the Collatz Conjecture, one of the popular mathmatical problems that still seems to be unsovable.

## What is the Collatz Conjecture?
It derives from the Collatz Problem. The Collatz Problem has been discovered by the german mathemetician Lothar Collatz. It describes no matter at which positive integer you start and apply the two rules creating a sequence you will always get caught at the end in the 4-2-1 sequence loop.
Collatz Conjecture is however a visualization of a sequence (or multiple sequences).

## The Rules
1. Take a positive number n (greater than 0).
2. If the number is even, divide it by 2; other than that multiply it by 3 and add 1.
3. Apply the rules as described in the second step for the result until you reached 1.

## How the program works
* User needs to give the type of visualization the sequence should be displayd in as an argument when starting the program (options to choose from: punctual or fancy [coming soon])
* User will be asked for a positive whole number. The number shouldn't be greater than 300 since the window cuts the visualization off.
* A new window opens up with the graph
