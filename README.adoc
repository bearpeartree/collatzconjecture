Trying to visualize the Collatz Conjecture, one of the popular mathmatical problems that still seems to be unsovable.

## What is the Collatz Conjecture?
It derives from the Collatz Problem. The Collatz Problem has been discovered by the german mathemetician Lothar Collatz. It describes no matter at which positive integer you start and apply the two rules creating a sequence you will always get caught at the end in the 4-2-1 sequence loop.
Collatz Conjecture is however a visualization of a sequence (or multiple sequences).

## The Rules
1. Take a positive number n (greater than 0).
2. If the number is even, divide it by 2; other than that multiply it by 3 and add 1.
3. Apply the rules as described in the second step for the result until you reached 1.

## How the program works
* User needs to give a number (greater than 0) as an argument when starting the program
* User will be asked which type of visualization the sequence should be displayed (punctual - fancy[coming soon])
* A new window opens up with the graph
